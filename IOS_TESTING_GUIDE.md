# iOS Testing Guide

## üçé Building for iOS

### Prerequisites
- macOS with Xcode installed
- Qt 6.8.2 with iOS kit configured
- iOS Simulator or physical iOS device

### Build Steps
1. **Open in Qt Creator**
   ```
   File ‚Üí Open File or Project ‚Üí NotificationApp.pro
   ```

2. **Select iOS Kit**
   - In the kit selector (bottom left), choose your iOS kit
   - For simulator: "iOS Simulator" kit
   - For device: "iOS Device" kit

3. **Build Project**
   ```
   Build ‚Üí Build Project "NotificationApp"
   ```

4. **Run on Simulator**
   ```
   Run ‚Üí Run (Cmd+R)
   ```

## üß™ Testing Notifications

### Step 1: Test Permission Request
1. Launch the app in iOS Simulator
2. Tap "Request Permission" button
3. **Expected**: iOS permission dialog should appear
4. Grant permission

### Step 2: Send Test Notification (App Running)
**Method A: Using Simulator Menu**
1. In iOS Simulator: `Device ‚Üí Notifications ‚Üí Send Notification`
2. Or use the notification center

**Method B: Using Command Line**
```bash
# Send a test notification to the simulator
xcrun simctl push booted com.example.notificationapp notification.json
```

Create `notification.json`:
```json
{
  "aps": {
    "alert": {
      "title": "Test Notification",
      "body": "This is a test notification from command line"
    },
    "badge": 1,
    "sound": "default"
  },
  "customData": {
    "message": "Hello from test notification!",
    "timestamp": "2024-01-01T12:00:00Z"
  }
}
```

### Step 3: Test Background Launch
1. **Close the app completely**
   - Double-tap home button (or swipe up)
   - Swipe up on the app to close it
   - Or use `Cmd+Shift+H` twice in simulator

2. **Send notification** (using Method A or B above)

3. **Tap the notification** when it appears

4. **Expected Result**:
   - App should launch
   - Main screen should show notification content
   - Should display: "Opened from notification: [notification data]"

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Build Issues
- **"iOS kit not found"**: Install Xcode and configure iOS kit in Qt Creator
- **"Provisioning profile"**: For device testing, you need Apple Developer account
- **"Architecture mismatch"**: Ensure Qt is built for iOS architecture

### Runtime Issues
- **Permission dialog not appearing**: Check iOS deployment target (iOS 10+)
- **Notifications not received**: Verify bundle identifier matches
- **App not launching from notification**: Check Info.plist configuration

### Debug Output
Check Qt Creator's "Application Output" pane for debug messages:
```
IOSNotificationHandler::initialize() - iOS implementation
IOSNotificationHandler::requestPermission() - requesting...
```

## üì± Testing on Physical Device

1. **Connect iOS device**
2. **Select device kit** in Qt Creator
3. **Configure signing** (requires Apple Developer account)
4. **Build and deploy**

Note: Physical device testing requires proper code signing and provisioning profiles.

## üéØ Success Criteria

‚úÖ App builds and runs on iOS Simulator  
‚úÖ Permission request dialog appears and works  
‚úÖ Notifications are received while app is running  
‚úÖ App launches from notification when terminated  
‚úÖ Notification content is displayed in the app  

## Next Steps

Once iOS testing is complete, we can:
- Refine the notification handling
- Add more notification features
- Test on physical devices
- Optimize the cross-platform code
