# iOS Compilation Fix

## Problem
Compilation error: `'s_notificationManager' is a private member of 'IOSNotificationHandler'` in lines 43 and 44 of `iosnotificationhandler.mm`.

## Root Cause
The static member `s_notificationManager` was declared as a private member, making it inaccessible to the Objective-C callback functions in the `.mm` file. These callback functions are not class member functions, so they cannot access private static members.

## Solution

### 1. Header File Changes (`iosnotificationhandler.h`)
**Before:**
```cpp
private:
    static NotificationManager *s_notificationManager;  // ❌ Private member
    static void *s_delegate;
```

**After:**
```cpp
public:
    // Public static member for callback access
    static NotificationManager *s_notificationManager;  // ✅ Public member

private:
    static void *s_delegate;
```

### 2. Static Member Definition
**Before:** Defined in `.mm` file only
```cpp
// iosnotificationhandler.mm
NotificationManager *IOSNotificationHandler::s_notificationManager = nullptr;
```

**After:** Defined in `.cpp` file (shared across platforms)
```cpp
// iosnotificationhandler.cpp
NotificationManager *IOSNotificationHandler::s_notificationManager = nullptr;
```

### 3. Additional Changes
- Added `#include "notificationmanager.h"` to `.cpp` file
- Updated stub implementation to set the static member
- Removed duplicate definition from `.mm` file
- Fixed static member access patterns:
  - Objective-C callbacks/blocks: `IOSNotificationHandler::s_notificationManager`
  - Class member functions: `s_notificationManager`

## Result
- ✅ Static member accessible from Objective-C callback functions
- ✅ No duplicate symbol errors
- ✅ Works on both iOS and non-iOS platforms
- ✅ Callback functions can now access the notification manager

## Files Modified
1. `src/iosnotificationhandler.h` - Made static member public for callback access
2. `src/iosnotificationhandler.cpp` - Added static member definition and header include
3. `src/iosnotificationhandler.mm` - Removed duplicate definition and made access consistent

The iOS build should now compile successfully!
